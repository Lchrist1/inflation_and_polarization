# Phillips-Salience

This is a work in progress where I am exploring the use of google trends data to estimate the causal effect of political polarization on inflation expectations. 

At this point, I have replicated the phillips curve relationship in google trends data (this is the only public file avaialble in this repository at this point) as shown by Professor Williamson of the University of Miami (https://x.com/Bellmanequation/status/1516125998189842432?s=20). My next step is to match the google trends data to MIT elections data at the county level and generate descriptive analyses on their assosciations.
